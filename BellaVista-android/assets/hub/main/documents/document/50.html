CHIEF COMPLIANT: chest pain

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:

JONES,CHRISTOPHER is a 57 year-old MALE 
presenting to the emergency department with chest pain for the
last XX weeks. Patient described the pain as a pressure situation, that
radiated up to his jaw, was associated with palpitation, dyspnea, diaphoresis,
nausea, and lightheadedness. These episodes have been increasing in intensity
and frequency in a typical crescendo pattern.

Cardiac risk factors include male, age over 55yo, smoker, hypertension, and
diabetes. 

Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was immediately triaged to cardiac bay
where rapid TnI assay was performed and patient monitored. An EKG and CXR were 
performed. He was given morphine, nitro, and a betablocker. 

Cardiology was consulted given the EKG findings and a + troponin assay.

Cardiology team saw patient immediately in the ED, and confirmed diagnosis and
their desire to proceed to immediate revascularization. Cardiac catheterization
showed a totally occluded left anterior descending artery (LAD).

The decision was made to perform an angioplasty using a drug eluting Cypher
stent. The stent  was placed in the XX. Patient was subsequently transferred
to recovery and later to CCU. 

Patient is resting quietly, and unavailble for questioning during my 
evauation. PMHx is obtained from the patient and wife who was present in the
room.
