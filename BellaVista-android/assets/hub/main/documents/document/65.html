HPI:    55 year-old male presents to the emergency department after resolution 
        of a 20-minute episode of chest pain, which began while he was raking 
        leaves. The pain was described as a "pressure" sensation. The pain 
        radiated down his arms and into his jaw and was associated with 
        palpitations and dyspnea. The pain resolved shortly after resting. The 
        patient had 3 prior episodes of similar pain today, lasting 
        approximately 10 minutes each, and all with activity. He has complained
of diaphoresis, mild nausea, and shortness of breath intermittently the 
        last 3 weeks along with lightheadedness when ambulating up stairs. He 
        denies muscle pain, pain with inspiration or movement, cough, or other 
        associated chest complaints.

and 
        hypertension.  He presently is prescribed HCTZ but states that he 
        occasionally misses. Wife states she thinks he is supposed to be taking
some other medications but he is usually non-compliant.

        55. He has no known allergies.
