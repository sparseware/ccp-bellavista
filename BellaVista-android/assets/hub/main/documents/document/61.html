CC:     "Chest pain while working in yard"

HPI:	55 year-old male presents to the emergency department after resolution
	of a 20-minute episode of chest pain, which began while he was mowing the
 	lawn. The pain was described as a "strong pressure" sensation. The pain 
        radiated down his arms and into his jaw and was not associated with 
        palpitations and dyspnea this time. The pain resolved shortly after
 	resting. The patient had 3 prior episodes of similar pain yesterday lasting 
        approximately 5-10 minutes each, and all with activity. At that time he
  	complained of having diaphoresis, mild nausea, and shortness of breath
 	intermittently the last 3 weeks along with lightheadedness when ambulating up
 	stairs. He denies muscle pain, pain with inspiration or movement, cough, or
 	other associated chest complaints. 

PMHx:   His past medical history is significant for diet controlled diabetes
	and hypertension.  He presently is prescribed HCTZ but states that he 
        occasionally misses. Wife states she thinks he is supposed to be taking
	some other medications but he is usually non-compliant. 

FHx:    Family history is significant for a sister who had an acute MI at age 
        55. He has no known allergies.

SHx:    Patient works as a cab company dispatcher. Lives with wife. He
	currently smokes 1 pack per day. Denies illegal drug use.
