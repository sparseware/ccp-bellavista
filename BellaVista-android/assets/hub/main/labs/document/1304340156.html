        : Hepatitis B surface antibody generally appears after recovery from acute hepatitis B. 
        However, Hepatitis B surface antibody can result from response to the HBV vaccine, from 
        passive transfer after a blood transfusion (or globulin injection) or represent a 
        non-specific reaction.  Hepatitis B core antibody would help define positivity due to 
        hepatitis B infection. Generally, the presence of Hepatitis B surface antibody indicates 
        immunity to hepatitis B virus.
